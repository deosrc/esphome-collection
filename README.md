# ESPHome Collection

A collection of ESPHome configuration packages for building custom Internet of
Things devices.

The collection is split into areas:

- **[Components](./components/):** ESPHome external components for new hardware,
  code re-use, or other purposes.
- **[Devices](./devices/README.md):** Hardware configuration providing components
  which can be extended with custom functionality.
- **[Packages](./packages/):** Functionality which can be imported and re-used
  across devices (e.g. auto-brightness control from Home Assistant sensors).
